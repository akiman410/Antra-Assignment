-All scenarios are based on Database NORTHWND.

--1.      List all cities that have both Employees and Customers.

SELECT DISTINCT c.City  
FROM Customers c
WHERE c.City IN (SELECT City FROM Employees)

--2.      List all cities that have Customers but no Employee.
--a.      Use sub-query

SELECT DISTINCT c.City
FROM Customers c 
WHERE c.City IN (SELECT City from Employees WHERE City IS NOT NULL)
--b.      Do not use sub-query
SELECT Distinct c.City
FROM Customers c LEFT OUTER JOIN  Employees e ON c.City = e.City
WHERE c.city = e.City

--3.      List all products and their total order quantities throughout all orders.
SELECT p.ProductID, p.ProductName, SUM(od.OrderID) AS TotalOrder
FROM Products p INNER JOIN [Order Details] od ON p.ProductID = od.ProductID
GROUP BY p.ProductID, p.ProductName

--4.      List all Customer Cities and total products ordered by that city.
SELECT c.City, SUM(od.ProductID) AS TotalProduct
FROM Customers c 
INNER JOIN Orders o ON c.CustomerID = o.CustomerID
INNER JOIN  [Order Details] od ON o.OrderID = od.OrderID
GROUP BY c.City

--5.      List all Customer Cities that have at least two customers.



--a.      Use union
SELECT c.City 
FROM customers c
GROUP BY c.City
HAVING COUNT(*)>2
UNION
SELECT e.City 
FROM customers e
GROUP BY e.City
HAVING COUNT(*)=0

--b.      Use sub-query and no union

SELECT c.City
FROM Customers c
GROUP BY c.City
Having COUNT(c.City)> 2

--6.      List all Customer Cities that have ordered at least two different kinds of products.

SELECT c.City, COUNT(*) AS TotalOrder
FROM Customers c 
INNER JOIN Orders o ON c.CustomerID = o.CustomerID
INNER JOIN  [Order Details] od ON o.OrderID = od.OrderID
GROUP BY c.City
HAVING Count(*) >1

--7.      List all Customers who have ordered products, but have the ‘ship city’ on the order different from their own customer cities.
SELECT DISTINCT c.CustomerID, c.City, o.ShipCity
FROM Customers c
INNER JOIN Orders o ON c.CustomerID = o.CustomerID
WHERE c.City != o.ShipCity

--8.      List 5 most popular products, their average price, and the customer city that ordered most quantity of it.
SELECT TOP 5 od.ProductID,  AVG(od.UnitPrice) AS AvgUnitPrice, c.City
FROM Customers c
INNER JOIN Orders o ON c.CustomerID = o.CustomerID
INNER JOIN  [Order Details] od ON o.OrderID = od.OrderID
WHERE c.City IN (SELECT TOP 5 c.City FROM Customers ORDER BY od.Quantity desc )
GROUP BY od.ProductID, c.City

--9.      List all cities that have never ordered something but we have employees there.

--a.      Use sub-query
SELECT e.City
FROM Employees e
WHERE e.City NOT IN
(SELECT o.ShipCity
FROM Orders o
WHERE o.OrderID IS NOT NULL)

--b.      Do not use sub-query

SELECT e.City
FROM Employees e 
Except Select o.ShipCity 
FROM Orders o
WHERE o.ShipCity IS NOT NULL

--10.  List one city, if exists, that is the city from where the employee sold most orders (not the product quantity) is, and also the city of most total quantity of products ordered from. (tip: join  sub-query)
