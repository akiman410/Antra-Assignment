--All scenarios are based on Database NORTHWND.

--1.      List all cities that have both Employees and Customers.
SELECT e.City FROM Employees e
WHERE e.CITY IN (SELECT c.City FROM Customers c)

--2.      List all cities that have Customers but no Employee.

--a.      Use sub-query
SELECT e.City FROM Employees e
WHERE e.CITY NOT IN (SELECT c.City FROM Customers c)

--b.      Do not use sub-query
SELECT DISTINCT c.City 
FROM Customers c JOIN Employees e ON c.city = e.City


--3.      List all products and their total order quantities throughout all orders.
SELECT p.ProductName, COUNT(o.OrderID) AS NumOfOrders
FROM [Order Details] o JOIN Products p ON o.ProductID = p.ProductID
GROUP BY p.ProductName
ORDER BY NumOfOrders DESC

--4.      List all Customer Cities and total products ordered by that city.

SELECT c.City, COUNT(o.OrderID) NumOfOrders
FROM Customers c JOIN Orders o ON c.CustomerID = o.CustomerID
GROUP BY c.City
ORDER BY NumOfOrders DESC

--5.      List all Customer Cities that have at least two customers.

--a.      Use union

--b.      Use sub-query and no union
SELECT c.City
FROM Customers c
WHERE CustomerID IN (SELECT CustomerID FROM Orders WHERE COUNT(CustomerID)>2  )

--6.      List all Customer Cities that have ordered at least two different kinds of products.

--7.      List all Customers who have ordered products, but have the ‘ship city’ on the order different from their own customer cities.

--8.      List 5 most popular products, their average price, and the customer city that ordered most quantity of it.

--9.      List all cities that have never ordered something but we have employees there.

--a.      Use sub-query

--b.      Do not use sub-query

--10.  List one city, if exists, that is the city from where the employee sold most orders (not the product quantity) is, and also the city of most total quantity of products ordered from. (tip: join  sub-query)

--11. How do you remove the duplicates record of a table?
